Applied Machine Learning Coursework Project

• Performed extensive data cleanup on a large dataset of 809247*21, improving data quality and eliminating missing values and nulls.
• Engineered 12 new features to enhance the model's accuracy, leading to improved predictions and insights.
• Trained two models, logistic regression (sklearn) and H2O GLM model, utilizing various techniques such as MinMax scaling, standard scaling, one hot encoding and target encoding. Standard scaling provided a better accuracy compared to MinMax scaling.
• Achieved an accuracy of 84% and an F1 score of 91% on the validation dataset, demonstrating the logistic regression model's effectiveness.
• Performed hyper-parameter tuning and fine-tuned the best model by trying different regularization techniques such as l1, l2 and elasticnet, increasing its accuracy and robustness.
• Checked probability threshold which maximized F1 on separate test data set which provided 78% F1 score.
• Successfully completed a machine learning project, showcasing strong problem-solving skills, data analysis abilities, and proficiency in various data science techniques.
